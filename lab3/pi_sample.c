/*
Sample a random point (x, y) in the square [-1, 1] * [-1, 1].
There is a unit circle C centered on (0, 0) with a radius of 1.
The probability that a randomly chosen point falls inside
the circle C is exactly PI / 4.

Estimate the value of PI with a precision of 1e-3 by sampling
a sufficient number of points.
